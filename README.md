There's a big demand for React in todays work environment. 

My reasons are to get a grasp of web development to the higher degrees, understand trends, how people use the UI and gain more knowledge on web environments.

I'm beginning with a 30-days-of-react for the month of September. My goal for this month is to build an E-commerce app.

## Learnings

### 1. JSX: 

  - Javascript XML which is commonly used in React apps. It's compulsory and makes code more readable, reliable and easy to modify.
  
  -It utilizes HTML syntax to create elements and component. Which means, it has tags, attrubytes abd children.
  


### 2. Hooks':

- Hooks allow using State and other React features without creating a class. 

- Added in React 16.8 as a feature which doesnâ€™t need to add classes to maintain a state which was possible in Stateful class component but was not possible in Stateless Functional component.

- Hooks allow using State and other React features without creating a class.

### 3. Props:

- "Props" is the short form for properties used in React application.

- Props contains a single value or objects in key-value pair having a set of values, that is used, similar to HTML tag attributes, when passing to React Component while creating.

- Props are immutable and their value cannot be changed. If we assign props a new value in component, it will not change though it will return a runtime error.

```js
<DataProvider render={data => (
  <h1>Hello {data.target}</h1>
)}/>
  ```

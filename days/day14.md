## Learnings

### 1. Organizing our project

- Our topic for the day is how go about organizing a project after planning.  

- However, having a job on the day time and social activities makes this tiring. It's only 20:50 and I'm dead tired, so for today, things will just have to wait until tomorrow.


## Challenges

- Nothing
  
## Tomorrow's focus

- ACTUALLY Organizing the code
